# {{ORG_NAME}} — Evidence Repository (for P2P-ness Assessment)

Purpose: Collect verifiable data and links about {{ORG_NAME}}, organized by the evaluation framework in `Principles of p2p.md` (layers × dimensions × levels). Each item should include a short note and source link(s).

## Variables (set these first)
- ORG_NAME: {{ORG_NAME}}
- PRIMARY_URLS: {{PRIMARY_URLS}}
- FORUM_URL: {{FORUM_URL}}
- MAIN_SITE: {{MAIN_SITE}}
- GITHUB_ORG_URL: {{GITHUB_ORG_URL}}
- DOCS_OR_MANUAL_URL: {{DOCS_OR_MANUAL_URL}}
- BLOG_OR_NEWS_URL: {{BLOG_OR_NEWS_URL}}
- SNAPSHOT_SPACE: {{SNAPSHOT_SPACE_OR_URL}}
- TALLY_SPACE: {{TALLY_SPACE_OR_URL}}

## Method: Web Search & Capture Protocol
- Run parallel searches across:
  - Official site, forum/governance, docs/handbook/manual, blog/newsroom
  - GitHub org (repos, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, governance files)
  - Voting portals (Snapshot/Tally), foundation filings, whitepapers
- Use a consistent citation style: include the public URL for every claim.
- Capture in this format under each dimension:
  - Findings: 1–3 bullets, concise, factual
  - Citations: 1–3 links (prefer primary sources)

### Query bank (replace {{ORG_NAME}})
- "site:{{MAIN_SITE_HOST}} governance"; "site:{{FORUM_HOST}} proposal governance process"; "site:{{DOCS_HOST}} governance overview"; "site:github.com {{ORG_NAME}} license"
- "{{ORG_NAME}} foundation legal wrapper jurisdiction"; "{{ORG_NAME}} Snapshot space"; "{{ORG_NAME}} Tally proposals"
- "{{ORG_NAME}} grants round recap"; "{{ORG_NAME}} maturity framework"; "{{ORG_NAME}} brand trademark policy"
