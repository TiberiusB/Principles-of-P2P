# {{ORG_NAME}} — P2P-ness Compilation & Scoring

This document compiles quantitative scores and rationales derived from evidence in `template_data.md`, following `Principles of p2p.md`, plus hybrid analysis (`Hybrid models.md`) and ethos assessment (`Ethos.md`).

## Scoring Scale (0–5)
- 0 = Absent / contrary to P2P
- 1 = Weak / token
- 2 = Partial / significant gaps
- 3 = Moderate / functional
- 4 = Strong / high fidelity
- 5 = Exemplary / benchmark

Note: If using the 0–3 mapping, translate: 0→0, 1→1–2, 2→3–4, 3→5.

## Layer 1: Structural/Formal

| Infrastructure & Commons |  |  |  |  |  |

## Layer 2: Operational/Process

| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Transparency & Access to Information |  |  |  |  |  |
| Coordination of Tasks & Workflows |  |  |  |  |  |
| Contribution Logging & Attribution |  |  |  |  |  |
| Conflict Management & Forking |  |  |  |  |  |
| Reputation, Trust & Accountability |  |  |  |  |  |

## Layer 3: Economic

| Dimension | Project | Open-Enterprise | Network | Global | Rationale (evidence refs) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Property Regime & Licensing |  |  |  |  |  |
| Contribution & Value Accounting / Benefit Distribution |  |  |  |  |  |

| Tokenomics & Incentives (if applicable) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Cost Structure & Sustainability |  |  |  |  |  |
| Economic Openness & Cost Transparency |  |  |  |  |  |

## Layer 4: Cultural/Ecosystem/Superstructural

| Dimension | Project | Open-Enterprise | Network | Global | Rationale (evidence refs) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Values, Norms & Culture |  |  |  |  |  |
| Learning, Adaptation & Innovation |  |  |  |  |  |
| Meaning, Purpose & Identity |  |  |  |  |  |
| Ecosystem Relations & External Engagement |  |  |  |  |  |

## Totals
- Structural average:  
- Operational average:  
- Economic average:  
- Cultural/Ecosystem average:  
- Overall P2P-ness (simple avg of layer avgs):  

## Hybridization X-ray (per `Hybrid models.md`)
- Legal existence/entity:
- Ownership of IP/outputs:
- Capital structure/funding:
- Decision-making:
- Formal vs emergent authority:
- Contribution accounting & rewards:
- Revenue model:
- Infrastructure control:
- Roadmap ownership:
- Trademark/brand control:

Red flags to check:
- CLA assigning IP centrally; token/equity concentration; roadmap capture by single employer; trademark constraints on forks.

## Ethos Assessment (per `Ethos.md`)
| Ethos Dimension | Score (0–5) | Short rationale (citations) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Openness / Access |  |  |
| Transparency |  |  |
| Contribution & Recognition |  |  |
| Stewardship of Commons |  |  |
| Decentralization / Distributed Influence |  |  |
| Self-organization / Initiative |  |  |
| Fairness / Equity |  |  |
| Resilience / Adaptability |  |  |
| Reliability / Trustworthiness |  |  |
| Mission / Shared Purpose |  |  |
| Non-domination / Anti-hierarchy |  |  |
| Quality of Peer Interactions |  |  |
