Add-on,"The core ofering is priced competitively, but there are numerous extras that drive the final price up, in the end the customer pays more than what was originaly assumed. ","You offer a base model of a modular and extensible artifact. Benefits from helping others customize, add functionality, and interoperate with other existing offers / artifacts (ecosystem of artifacts).","A core group of hardware developers develop a basic model of a machine (ex. a meet grinder), that could have multiple uses (grind meet, make sousage, make juice). Once they create that, they wait for adopters to ask them to extend the functionality acording to their needs (someone wants to make sousage). They reward the designers for their work on adding on new functionality.  
Operating under this model has consequences on how the core groups of designers conceve the original thing. It must be modular and extensible, to fit new functionality that mey not even be imagined in the beginning of the process. 
The original central piece might be bootstrapped, but the rest of the functionality that will be built around can be rewarded by users. 
The add-ons can also be external modules for adapting the device to local conditions, such as local power grid (power adaptgers). 
They can also be UX / UI features, such as automation and control pannels. 
This model also applies to services. for example, a local makerspace can offer a base fee for accessing the lab, but at the same time offer extra services for accessing specific machines or know-how (consulting, technical support and education).",,
Affiliation,"The focus lies in supporting others to sell products successfuly, thus benefiting from succesful transactions. Affiliates usually have some kind of pay-per-sale or pay-per-order play system. ","Mainly related to distribution or dissemination. Your role is to cordinate the process by utilizing other agents (affiliates) in the ecosystem and rewarding them in proportion to their results / achievements / success, from whih you directly benefit. The focus lies in supporting others to distribute or locally fabricate, thus you can benefit from their successful operations and transactions.",Ex. Your offer is DIY.,,
Aikido,"Aikido is a Japanese martial art in which the strenght of an attacker is used against himself. As a business model, Aikido allows a company to offer something diametrically opposed to the image and mindset of the competition. ",Offer something diametrically opposed to the image and mindset of other actors in the ecosystem. ,"For example, DIY hardware is not distributed as a product and is highly customizable, thus changing the paradigm of market-based product distribution. This model of hardware production is very disruptive. ",,
Auction,It involves selling product or service to the highest bidder. The final price is atteined at a predetermined moment or when no higher bid has been received. This allows the company to see to the highest price and the customert to influence the price of the product.  ,"Offer to the highest bidder, to whom makes you benefits the most (not just money). You can benefit more and the receiver (highest bidder) increases the valuation of your offer.",,,
Barter,Barter is a method of exchanging goods with no transfer of money. In the context of business the customer provides something of value to the sponsoring organization.,"Offer something in exchange of something else, not money.  ",,,
Cash Machine,The customer pays upfront from the products sold before the company has to convert the associated expenses. This results in incrdeased liquidity that can be used to amortize bedt or fund investment in other areas. ,Offer somethign and ask for reciprocation ahead of production and delivery / distribution. ,,,
Cross-selling,"Services or products from an outside business are added to the offerings, thus leveraging existing key skills and resources. In retail especially, companies can easily provide additional products and offerings, by generating new revenue streams with minimum effort. ",Offer other agents' offerings along with yours.,,,
Crowdfunding,"A product, project or entire start-up is financed by a group of investors who wish to support the underlying idea typically via the internet. Is the critical mass is achieved the idea will be realized and investors receive benefits according to the amount of money invested",Source your offering with contributions from the crowd. Contributors (risk takers) will receive benefits. You also assess the real need  (demand) of your offering.,,,
Crowdsourcing,"The solution to a task or problem is adopted by an anonymous crowd, typically via the internet. Contributors receive a small reward or have a chance to win a prize if their solution is chosen for production and sale.","Your offering is designed and built / produced and even distributed by the crowd. In other words, your production and distribution is crowdsourced",,,
Loyalty,"Customers are retained and loyalty assured by providing value over and above the product or the service itself, for example  through incentive-based proagrams","Provide more than what is expected from you, beyound your main offering, use incentive-based programs.",,,
Digitization,"The pattern relies on the ability to turn existing products and services into digital versions themselves, which thus offers advantages over tangible products such as easier and more rapid distribution","Turn existing products and services into digital versions of themselves, gain advantage over tangible products such as easier and more rapid disemination / distribution. Ex. DIY, distribute files and let people produce locally using digital fabrication.",,,
Direct Selling,"Direct selling refers to a scenario whereby a company's products are not sold through an intermediary but are available directly from the manufacturer or service provider. In this way, the company retains a higher margin and cuts the middleman",You don't use intermediaries for your offerings. You are in direct contact with your beneficiaries.,,,
E-commerce,"Traditional products or services are delivered through online channels only, this removing costs associated with running a physical branch infrastructure. Customers benefit from greater availability and convenience.",Use online channels to disseminate your offerings. ,,,
Experience Selling,The value of a product or service is increased by an additional customer experience offered with it. This opens the door to higher customers demand and an increase in the price charged.,Provide an experience with your offering to your beneficiary. Leads to better relations and greater benefits.,,,
Flat Rate,"A single fixed fee is charged for a product or service, regardless of actual usage. The user benefits from a simple cost structure while the company benefits from a constant revenue stream.","Your offering is provided under simple conditions, regardless of the extent of the use or the quantity used. This simplifies operations, can create a constant stream of benefits.","For example a local makerspace offers access to the lab at a flat rate, no matter how much the users spend working in it. This can also be extended to use of equipment, instead of pay-per-hour, a flat access rate is applied, no matter how much time the equipment is used. The flat rate concept can be extended beyound monetary currency, which is to say that access to participation or usage can be granted after a minimum of contributions to the community, in an unlimited fashion. For example, one can gain unlimited access to a makerspace if 10 hours of community work has been logged in a week.  
In the digital realm, some services can be offered at a flat rate. for example, subscription to an online repository or hardware design software, etc. ",,
Fractional Ownership,"Sharing of a certain asset class among a group of owners. Typically the asset is capital-intensive but is only required on an occasional basis. While the customer benefits from the owner's rights, the entire capital does not have to be provided by him or her alone.","Share and mutualize, or help your beneficiaries to gain access to shared assets at low costs. ",,Ex. access to a Makerspace or a Fablab.,
Franchizing,"The franchisor owns the brand name, products and corporate identity and licenses them to independent franchisees who bear the risk of local operations. The franchisee benefits from the marketing of well-known brands and the availability of know-how and support.","Build a brand / identity and create other organizations that operate in the same fashion, standardized operations accross the ntework. Mutualize processes and assets accross the network. ",,Ex. Plastiskul,
Freemium,"The basic version of an item is offered for free in the hope of eventually persuading customers to purchase a premium version. The free offering attracts the highest volume of customers possible for the company., while revenue is generated by premium customers.","Basic offering to anyone, no questions asked, ask reciprocation for a premium offering. The free offer attracts potential beneficiaries / users, while your sustainability is ensured by your power users / beneficiaries. ",,,

",,,
Hidden Revenue,"The logic that the income of the business depends on the users is abandoned. instead, the main source of revenue comes from a third party, who cross-finances whatever free or low-priced offering attracts the user. A very common application is financing through advertising.",Your sustainability is linked not directly with your beneficiaries but with third parties. These third parties source your operations to attract users. Ex. financing through advertizing. ,,,
Ingredient Branding,This is the inclusion of a branded ingredient originating from different suppliers into a product. The principal product is then advertised as containing the ingredient product and stressing the added value it brings to the customer.,Include an very well-known and prized ingredient in your offering. Your offering will be noticed for containing that special ingredient. This ingredient can also be immaterial (ex. fair trade label) and even intangible (ex. spiritual dimension).  ,,,
Integrator,A company functioning on the integrator model has command of the majority of the steps in the value-adding process including all resources and capabilities in terms of value creation. Efficiency gains economies of scope and reduces dependency on suppliers.,"Reduce dependency on other entities in your ecosystem, produce your offerings from A to Z, independently. Reduce costs and gain better control over the process, applying your own methods and tools. You may have efficiency gains, economy of scope, control your risk. ",,,
Layer Player,A layer player is a specialized company limited to providing one value-adding step to different value chains.

Efficnent production because specialization, benefit from scale. Ex. local food basket, composed of offerings from various small local producers. ",,,
Leverage Customer / user Data,New value is created using customer data and preparing it in beneficial ways for internal usage or transmission of interested third parties. Revenues are generated by either selling this data directly to others or leveraging them for the company's own purpouses ,"Leverage the data produced by participants, build analysis or dashboard services or provide it to third parties (which is not necesarelly bad in a p2p system where transparency is inportant and information must flow).

Allows an agent to focus ion innovation and let other agents take on production and distribution. ",,,
Lock-in,Customers are locked into a vendor's world of products and services. Transferring customs to another vendor is impossible without incurring substantial switching costs. This mechanism is affected either by technological mechanism or a high level of the interdependency of products and services. ,"Provide an ecosystem of highly interoperable or interdependent offerings, which generates switching costs or network effects. ",,,
Long Tail,"The main bulk of revenues is generated through a long tail of nice products, which individually neither demand high volumes nor allow a high margin. If a wide variety of these products is offered in sufficient amounts, the profits from the accumulated small sales can add up. ","Your sustainability rests on a large number of niche offerings (low demand), not on a small number of offerings.  ",,,
Make More of it,Know-how and other assets available in the company's are not only used to build its own products but are also offered to other companies. Thus sluck resources are used to create additional value besides those generated directly by the company's core value proposition.,Offer excess capacity (resources and even time/know-how) in your organizations to other organizations in exchange for benefits. Don't just focus on your own offerings.  ,,,
Mass Customization,"Customising products through mass production once seemed to be an impossible endeavor, but this has now changed with the development of modular products and production systems that enable efficient individualization of product. ","Modular and highly customizable offerings and systems por production (digital fabrication), individualize the offering. ",,,
No Frills,"No frills value creation focuses on the necessary minimum to deliver the core value proposition of a product or service, which will thus typically be very basic.

Your offering and the experience associated with it are prpoduced through this collaboration.","Open-Value-networks (OVN) act as ecosystem builders in the CBPP transactional setting. Classical economies assign costs and resources to manufacture products. In CBPP, classical operations fall and tasks are to be handled by a large network of collaborators. Building this ecosystem requires innovative tools and methods to adapt to this new transactional setting.",,
Open Source,"In open source software engineering, the source code of a product is not proprietary but is made freely accessible for anyone. Money is typically earned with services that are complimentary to the product, such as consulting and support.","Your sustainability comes from offering services complementary to open source offering(s), which are not a products, themselves are not sold.

Performance-based Contracting,"A product's price is not based upon the physical value, but on the performance or valuable outcome it delivers in the form of a service. Performance based contractors are often strongly integrated into the value creation process of their customers.

Leads to a stronger relation with your beneficiaries. ",,,
Razor BladeRent Instead of Buy,"The basic product is cheap or given away for free. The consumable that are needed to use or operate it, on the other hamd, are expensive and sold at high margins. The initial product's price lowers customers' barrier to purchase, while the subsequent recurring sales cross-finance it. Usualy, these products are technologically bound to each other to further enhance this effect. ","A basic offering that is made very accessible, which requires other parts / modules in order to operate properly, which ensure your sustainability. It is based on repetitive interactions with your beneficiaries - repetitive game. ",,,
Rent instead of buy,"The customer does not buy a product, but instead rents it. This lowers the capital typically needed to gain access to the product. The company itself benefits from higher profits on each product, as it is paid for the duration of the rental period.

","Share your benefits with your stakeholders, complementors and even with your rivals. Creates symbiotic effects. Offerings from various agents are merged, benefiting from merged advantageous properties, benefiting from the higher valuation of the agregated offer. One actor may benefit more financialy, while another one may benefit more from increased visibility and activity. ",,,
Reverse Engineering,"This pattern refers to obtaining a competitor's product, taking it apart and using this information to produce a similar or compatible product. Because no huge investment in research or development is necessary, these products can be offered at a lower price than the original product. ","Offer reproductions of other organizations' offerings, at lower costs, making them more accessible.  This is also the mode of production and reproduction in commons-based peer production, where development is done in the developed world by people with technical skills and time on their hands, and the models are then remixed and materialized in the developing world. ",,,
Reverse Innovation,"Simple and inexpensive products that were developed within and for emerging markets are also sold in industrial countries. The term ""reverse"" refers to the process by which new products are typically developed in industrial countries and then adappted to fit the emerging market needs. ",Your offer in the developed world is inspired from solutions developed in the developing world.,,,
Robin Hood,"the same product or service is provided to the rich at a much higher price than to the poor. Thus, the main bulk of profits are generated from the wealthy customer base. Serving the poor is nt profitable per se, but creates economies of scale, which other providers cannot achieve. Additionally, it has a positive effect on the company's image.

These transfered processes must not increase the valuation of your offer much. This increases efficiency, since the user can perform this process acording to his needs. ",,,
Shop in Shop,"Instead of opening new branches, a partner is chosen whos branches can profit from integrating the company's offerings in a way that initiated a small shop within another shop (a win-win situation). The hosting store can benefit from more attracted customers and is able to gain constant revenue from the hosted shop in the form of rent. The hosted company gains access to cheaper resources such as space, location or workforce.

The offer becomes more valuable as more groups or as more individual members of each group are participating. The two sides usually come from disparate groups, interested in transacting with each other. ",,,
Ultimate Luxury,This pattern describes the strategy of a company to focus on the upper side of society's pyramid. This allows a company to distinguish its products or services greatly from others.

User design,"Within user manufacturing, a customer is both the manufacturer and the customer. As an example, an online platform provides the customer with the necessary support in order to design and merchandise the product, e.g. product design software, manufacturing services, or an online shop to sell products. Thus, the company only supports the customers in their undertakings and benefits from their creativity. The customer benefits from the potential to realize entrepreneurial ideas without having to provide the required infrastructure. Revenue is then generated as part of the actual sales.

White Label,"A white label producer allows other companies to distribute its goods under their brands, so that it appears as if they are made by them. The same product or service is often sold by multiple marketers and under different brands. This way, various customer segments can be satisfied with the same product. ",,,,
Sensor as a Service,"The use of sensors permits additional services for physical offerings, or wholly new independent services. It is not the sensor that generates the primary revenue, but the analysis of the data that the sensor creates. Possibilities for real-time information can further strenghten the value proposition. ",,,,
Visualization,"The pattern describes the imitation of a traditionally physical process in a virtual environment. E.g. a virtual workspace. The advantage for the customer is the ability to interact with the process from any location or device. In exchange, the customer pays for access to the virtual service. ","Your offer is a digital twin, a digital / virtual representation of a thing, a process, or both. ",,,
Object self-service,"Through the use of sensors and inclusion in an IT-structure, and object can generate orders itself. This makes fully automated processes like replenishment possible, and increases the speed of interaction with the object. The customer is locked in, giving rise to reccurent revenue. ",,,,
Object as a Point of Sale,"The point of sale of consumables moves to the point of consumption. This generates a stronger lock-in and results in higher customer retention. When the point of sale is shifted away from competing products, the customer becomes less sensitive to proce.  ","The point of access of resources moves to the point of use. This generates a stronger confluence of peers and results in less possibility of design overlappings, not counting better usage of available resources. When the point of access is shifted away from collaborative designables the peer that seeks to develop new designs becomes less resourceful.",,,
Prosumer,"Companies enable the customer to become producers themselves. The customer is integrated into the value chain and can profit from resulting product, while the company has fewer investment costs for production and overhead.
